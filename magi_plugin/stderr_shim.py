"""Stderr write-buffering shim for MAGI's live status display.

When the status display renders live to ``sys.stderr``, any concurrent
diagnostic write lands inside the in-place redraw region and is wiped
on the next refresh tick. The primitives in this module structurally
enforce the display-active-stderr-quiet invariant: while the display is
active, ``sys.stderr`` is replaced with a write-only buffer, and on
exit the buffered content is replayed to the real stream after the
display has been stopped.

Extracted from :mod:`run_magi` so the orchestrator stays focused on
orchestration and the shim machinery is independently testable.
